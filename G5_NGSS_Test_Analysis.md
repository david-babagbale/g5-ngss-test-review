## 1. Test Construction Best Practices

### 1.1 General Principles

**Test Blueprint / Table of Specifications:**
A test blueprint is the architectural plan that defines item distribution across content domains and cognitive levels. It ensures construct validity — the test measures what it claims to measure. Every well-designed standardized test starts with a blueprint that specifies:
- Content domain distribution (which standards, what percentage)
- Cognitive complexity distribution (DOK levels)
- Item types (selected response, constructed response, technology-enhanced)
- Total number of items and testing time

**Item Writing Principles:**
- Each item should measure a **single learning objective/PE**
- Stems should be clearly worded, free of ambiguity, and avoid double negatives
- All distractors (wrong answers) should be plausible and based on common misconceptions
- Items should be independent (no item gives away the answer to another)
- Avoid "all of the above" or "none of the above"
- For NGSS specifically, items should be **three-dimensional** — integrating a Disciplinary Core Idea (DCI), a Science and Engineering Practice (SEP), and a Crosscutting Concept (CCC)

**Reliability & Validity:**
- Content validity is ensured by the blueprint (adequate coverage of all assessed PEs)
- Item analysis post-administration should examine: difficulty index (p-value), discrimination index, and distractor analysis
- A reliable test produces consistent results across administrations

### 1.2 Difficulty Distribution

**Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK) Framework:**

| DOK Level | Description | Science Example |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **1 — Recall** | Recall a fact, definition, term, or simple procedure | "What is the basic unit of all living things?" |
| **2 — Skill/Concept** | Use information, apply concepts, compare, classify, organize | "Based on the data table, which material is most dense?" |
| **3 — Strategic Thinking** | Reasoning, planning, developing explanations, analyzing evidence | "Design an investigation to test whether..." |
| **4 — Extended Thinking** | Investigate, synthesize across multiple sources, apply to real-world (typically NOT on standardized tests — reserved for classroom assessment) | Multi-week research projects |

**Recommended DOK Distribution for a G5 Science Standardized Test:**

| DOK Level | Percentage | For a 40-item test |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| DOK 1 (Recall) | 15–20% | 6–8 items |
| DOK 2 (Skill/Concept) | 50–60% | 20–24 items |
| DOK 3 (Strategic Thinking) | 25–30% | 10–12 items |
| DOK 4 (Extended) | 0% (classroom only) | 0 items |

**Key insight:** NGSS-aligned assessments emphasize DOK 2 and DOK 3 more heavily than traditional tests. Wisconsin's Forward Exam, for instance, uses NO DOK 1 items at all. The shift reflects NGSS's emphasis on practices (explaining, modeling, arguing from evidence) over simple recall.

**Classical Difficulty (P-value) Distribution:**

| Difficulty Band | P-value Range | Percentage |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| Hard | 0.40–0.60 | ~20% |
| Medium | 0.60–0.80 | ~60% |
| Easy | 0.80–1.00 | ~20% |

### 1.3 Grade 5 Science Test Specifics

**Comparable NGSS-Aligned State Tests:**

| State Test | Grade | Total Items/Points | Testing Time |
|------------|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| **CAST** (California) | 5 | 54–58 score points | ~2 hours |
| **STAAR** (Texas, TEKS-aligned) | 5 | 36 items | ~4 hours allotted |
| **NJSLA-S** (New Jersey) | 5 | ~40 items | ~2 hours |
| **SC READY** (South Carolina) | 4 (NGSS-aligned) | ~45 items | ~2 hours |

**Recommended test length:** **36–44 items** (multiple-choice + short constructed response)
- This balances adequate PE coverage with manageable testing time for 10-year-olds
- Testing time: 90–120 minutes

**Domain Distribution (based on CAST and NGSS PE counts):**

The California CAST weights each of the three science domains at approximately **one-third** of the total test. Engineering items are embedded within the three science domains. Based on NGSS PE counts and CAST precedent:

| Domain | NGSS PEs | % of Test | Items (on a 40-item test) |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Physical Science** (PS) | 6 PEs | ~30–35% | 12–14 |
| **Life Science** (LS) | 2 PEs | ~20–25% | 8–10 |
| **Earth & Space Science** (ESS) | 5 PEs | ~30–35% | 12–14 |
| **Engineering Design** (ETS) | 3 PEs (embedded) | ~10–15% | 4–6 (embedded in other domains) |

> **Note:** Life Science has only 2 PEs but they are broad (ecosystem dynamics, plant growth). Many test blueprints inflate LS representation to achieve roughly equal thirds, since LS concepts intertwine with PS (energy in food) and ESS (biosphere interactions).

#### NEW Q2 — 5-PS1-2 (Conservation of matter)
**DOK 2 | No image needed**

A student places an empty sealed plastic bag on a balance and records its mass as 15 grams. The student then opens the bag, places two effervescent tablets and 50 mL of water inside, and quickly seals the bag again. The tablets dissolve and gas bubbles form inside the sealed bag.

What will the balance most likely show as the mass of the sealed bag after the tablets have completely dissolved?

F. Less than 65 grams, because some matter was destroyed when the tablets dissolved
G. Exactly 65 grams, because matter is not created or destroyed when substances interact
H. More than 65 grams, because the gas adds extra mass to the bag
J. Exactly 50 grams, because the tablets disappeared into the water

**Correct Answer: G**
*SEP: Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking | CCC: Scale, Proportion, and Quantity*

---

#### NEW Q3 — 5-PS1-4 (Mixing substances — new substance?)
**DOK 2 | No image needed**

Students mix baking soda with vinegar in a cup. They observe bubbles forming, the mixture getting colder, and a fizzing sound. They also mix sand with water in a separate cup and observe the sand settling to the bottom.

Which statement best compares these two mixtures?

A. Both mixtures resulted in new substances being formed.
B. Neither mixture resulted in a new substance being formed.
C. The baking soda and vinegar formed a new substance, but the sand and water did not.
D. The sand and water formed a new substance, but the baking soda and vinegar did not.

**Correct Answer: C**
*SEP: Planning and Carrying Out Investigations | CCC: Cause and Effect*

---

#### NEW Q4 — 5-PS2-1 (Gravitational force directed down)
**DOK 2 | IMAGE RECOMMENDED — diagram of ball on a hill**

A student places a ball on a flat table. The ball does not move. The student then places the same ball at the top of a ramp. The ball immediately begins rolling down the ramp toward the ground.

Which statement best explains why the ball rolls down the ramp?

F. The ramp pushes the ball forward with a contact force.
G. The gravitational force exerted by Earth pulls the ball downward, toward the center of Earth.
H. Air pressure at the top of the ramp is greater than at the bottom, pushing the ball down.
J. The ball has more energy at the top of the ramp because it is farther from the sun.

**Correct Answer: G**
*SEP: Engaging in Argument from Evidence | CCC: Cause and Effect*

---

#### NEW Q5 — 5-PS2-1 (Gravitational force directed down)
**DOK 3 | IMAGE RECOMMENDED — person standing on a globe at different positions**

A student argues that if Earth is a sphere, a person standing on the bottom of Earth would fall off into space.

Which statement provides the best evidence against this argument?

A. Earth's atmosphere holds people to the surface on all sides of the planet.
B. People on the other side of Earth are actually upside down but are used to it.
C. Gravitational force pulls all objects toward the center of Earth, so "down" is always toward Earth's center no matter where a person stands.
D. The magnetic field of Earth holds all objects on the surface in place.

#### NEW Q8 — 5-LS2-1 (Movement of matter in ecosystems)
**DOK 3 | IMAGE RECOMMENDED — simple diagram showing sun → plants → animals → decomposers → soil → plants**

In a forest ecosystem, a tree takes in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to grow. A caterpillar eats the leaves of the tree. A bird eats the caterpillar. When the bird dies, decomposers break down its body.

Which statement best describes what happens to the matter from the tree's leaves throughout this process?

F. The matter is destroyed each time one organism eats another.
G. The matter moves from organism to organism and is eventually returned to the soil and air by decomposers.
H. The matter stays inside each organism permanently and is never recycled.
J. Only energy moves through the ecosystem; the matter stays in the tree.

| Star A | 2 times the sun | 4 light-years |
| Star B | 10,000 times the sun | 640 light-years |
| Star C | 0.5 times the sun | 11 light-years |

Star A appears brighter than Star B when observed from Earth, even though Star B produces much more light.

Which statement best explains this observation?

F. Star B is broken and not producing light correctly.
G. Earth's atmosphere blocks the light from Star B but not Star A.
H. Star A is much closer to Earth than Star B, so its light appears brighter even though it actually produces less light.
J. Star A is a newer star, so it naturally appears brighter.

**DOK 3 | No image needed**

A group of students is designing a container to keep an ice cube from melting for as long as possible. They can only use materials from their classroom. Three teams propose different designs:

| Team | Design | Materials Used |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Team 1 | Wrap ice in aluminum foil inside a plastic bag | Aluminum foil, plastic bag |
| Team 2 | Place ice in a small box stuffed with shredded newspaper | Cardboard box, newspaper |
| Team 3 | Place ice in a glass jar with no covering | Glass jar |

Based on what is known about how different materials conduct heat, which design is most likely to keep the ice cube frozen longest, and why?

A. Team 1, because aluminum foil keeps things cold
B. Team 2, because newspaper and cardboard are poor conductors of heat, so they slow down heat transfer to the ice
C. Team 3, because glass is the strongest material and protects the ice best
D. All three designs will work equally well

#### NEW Q17 — 3-5-ETS1-3 (Fair tests / controlled variables)
**DOK 3 | No image needed**

A student wants to test whether the type of soil affects how fast a bean seed sprouts. The student sets up three pots:

- Pot 1: Sandy soil, placed by a sunny window, watered daily with 50 mL of water
- Pot 2: Clay soil, placed in a dark closet, watered daily with 100 mL of water
- Pot 3: Potting soil, placed by a sunny window, watered daily with 50 mL of water

Why is this NOT a fair test?

A. The student used too many pots for the investigation.
B. The student should have used the same type of soil in all three pots.
C. The student changed more than one variable between the pots, so any differences in sprouting cannot be attributed only to the type of soil.
D. The student should not have watered the plants at all during the investigation.

## 7. Image Strategy

### 7.1 The Image Challenge

Many high-quality standardized test items require images: diagrams, data tables, photographs, models, charts, and experimental setups. In the 2021 STAAR test, approximately **18 out of 36 questions (50%)** included an image or diagram of some kind.

For an NGSS-aligned test, the need for visuals is even higher because NGSS emphasizes:
- **Models** (5-PS1-1, 5-LS2-1, 5-ESS2-1 — "develop a model")
- **Graphical data** (5-ESS1-2, 5-ESS2-2 — "represent data in graphical displays")
- **Investigation setups** (5-PS1-3, 5-PS1-4, 3-5-ETS1-3)

### 7.2 Questions in This Document That Need Images

Of the 19 new questions generated above:
- **7 questions** are marked "IMAGE RECOMMENDED" (Q4, Q5, Q8, Q10, Q11, Q12, Q16)
- **12 questions** work well as text-only items
- This ratio (~37% needing images) is deliberate — I prioritized writing text-based items for immediate usability

### 7.3 Recommended Image Sourcing Strategies

| Strategy | Details | Cost |
|----------|---------|------|
| **1. Commission from a graphic designer** | Hire a designer to create clean, standardized-test-style diagrams (line art, labeled diagrams, simple data displays). Provide them with detailed descriptions of what each image should show. | $15–50/image |
| **2. Use AI image generation tools** | Tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Adobe Firefly can generate scientific diagrams. Requires careful prompting and human review. Best for: food webs, ecosystem diagrams, experimental setups. Less reliable for: precise data charts, technical schematics. | $0–30/month |
| **3. Adapt images from open-source textbooks** | OpenStax, CK-12, and Wikimedia Commons offer Creative Commons-licensed science images suitable for assessments. | Free |
| **4. Create data displays in spreadsheet software** | For items requiring bar graphs, pie charts, or data tables (5-ESS1-2, 5-ESS2-2), create them in Excel/Google Sheets and export as images. These are high-fidelity and easy to produce. | Free |
| **5. Use released state test images as templates** | Study the visual style of CAST, NJSLA-S, and STAAR images, then recreate similar styles for your items. | Free |
| **6. Leverage the STAAR test images directly** | For the 12 strong-match STAAR items you're reusing, the original images are already in the PDF. Extract them for use. (Note: check TEA copyright/licensing terms for released tests.) | Free |

### 7.4 Which New Questions Can Skip Images Entirely

These question types work perfectly without images:
- Scenario-based explanation questions (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q6, Q7, Q9, Q13, Q14, Q15, Q17, Q18, Q19)
- Data-table questions where the table is embedded in the text stem (Q10, Q15, Q16 — tables included in the text above)

### 7.5 Recommended Approach

**Phase 1 (Immediate):** Deploy the 12 text-only new questions + 12 strong-match STAAR questions = **24 items ready now**

**Phase 2 (Short-term, 1–2 weeks):** Create images for the 7 image-recommended questions using spreadsheet tools (for data displays) and a graphic designer or AI tool (for diagrams). Deploy 9 modified STAAR questions. Total = **40 items**

**Phase 3 (Ongoing):** Build an expanding item bank by:
- Sourcing additional items from CAST/NJSLA-S released tests
- Writing new items each year for rotation
- Conducting item analysis after each administration to improve quality

## 8. Summary & Recommendations

### Key Numbers at a Glance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total STAAR 2021 items | 36 |
| Usable for NGSS G5 test (strong match) | 12 (33%) |
| Usable with modification (partial match) | 9 (25%) |
| Not usable (TEKS-only content) | 15 (42%) |
| New questions generated in this document | 19 |
| Total available for a 40-item test | **40** (21 from STAAR + 19 new) |
| NGSS PEs with zero STAAR coverage | 5 (PS2-1, ESS1-1, ETS1-1, ETS1-2, ETS1-3) |

### Recommendations

1. **Use the 12 strong-match STAAR items as-is** — they are field-tested, quality items already vetted by TEA
2. **Modify the 9 partial-match items** — adjust stems/contexts to better align with NGSS three-dimensional expectations
3. **Deploy the 19 new questions** after review by a content expert (science teacher or curriculum specialist)
4. **Source additional items from CAST released tests** — California's assessment is the gold standard for NGSS alignment
5. **Build a rotating item bank** — aim for 2–3x your test length (80–120 items) to enable form rotation across years
6. **Conduct item analysis** after the first administration — examine p-values and discrimination indices, and retire weak items
7. **Prioritize three-dimensional items** — every question should engage a DCI + SEP + CCC, not just recall a fact
