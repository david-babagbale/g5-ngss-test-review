# Audit Report: 19 Generated Questions vs. Quality Rules

> **Purpose:** This document audits every generated question (New Q1–Q19) against the item-writing rules compiled from Haladyna et al. (2002), NGSS assessment guidelines, and analysis of exemplary state test items. Each question is checked for: option length balance, distractor plausibility, assumed knowledge, three-dimensional integration, and other quality criteria.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| Severity | Count | Questions |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **SEVERE** (3x+ length imbalance or fundamental content flaw) | 3 | N2, N14, N18 |
| 🟠 **MAJOR** (2x length imbalance or significant flaw) | 6 | N5, N10, N13, N15, N17, N1 |
| 🟡 **MODERATE** (30-50% length imbalance or minor flaw) | 6 | N6, N7, N8, N12, N16, N19 |
| 🟢 **GOOD** (within 20% length, solid design) | 4 | N3, N4, N9, N11 |

**Overall finding:** 15 of 19 questions (79%) have the correct answer as the longest option, violating Rule 16 (option length homogeneity). This is a systematic, structural flaw that must be addressed before any question enters the test.

## DETAILED AUDIT

### 🔴 NEW Q18 — Solid vs. Gas Particles (SEVERE)
**PE:** 5-PS1-1 | **DOK:** 1

**Correct answer (F):** "The particles in a solid are locked in place and cannot move, while the particles in a gas move freely in all directions." — **22 words**
- Distractor G: "Solids have particles but gases do not contain particles." — 9 words
- Distractor H: "Gas particles are lighter than solid particles." — 7 words
- Distractor J: "Solids are always heavier than gases." — 6 words

**Length ratio:** Correct answer is **3.0x** the average distractor length (7.3 words).

**Violations:**
1. ⚠️ **Rule 16 — Length balance:** SEVERE violation. The correct answer is triple the distractor average. Any test-wise student would select the longest answer.
2. ⚠️ **Rule 20 — Homogeneity:** The correct answer is a complex compound sentence; distractors are simple single-clause statements.
3. ⚠️ **Rule 22 — Absolute terms:** Distractors G and J use absolute language ("do not contain," "always"), making them easily eliminable.

**Recommended fix:** Lengthen distractors to match the correct answer's two-part structure:
- F) The particles in a solid are locked in place, while gas particles move freely in all directions.
- G) The particles in a solid move freely in all directions, while gas particles are locked in place.
- H) The particles in a solid and a gas both move freely, but gas particles are lighter than solid particles.
- J) The particles in a solid and a gas are both locked in place, but gas particles take up more space.

### 🔴 NEW Q14 — Playground Design Problem (SEVERE)
**PE:** 3-5-ETS1-1 | **DOK:** 2

**Correct answer (G):** "The school needs to find a way to keep playground equipment cool enough to use safely on sunny days, using no more than $500 and within one week." — **25 words**
- Distractor F: "The school needs to build an air-conditioned playground for the students." — 11 words
- Distractor H: "The school needs to buy all new plastic playground equipment." — 9 words
- Distractor J: "The school needs to move recess to indoor spaces permanently." — 8 words

**Length ratio:** Correct answer is **2.7x** the average distractor length (9.3 words).

**Violations:**
1. ⚠️ **Rule 16 — Length balance:** SEVERE violation. The correct answer is nearly triple distractor length.
2. ⚠️ **Rule 20 — Structural homogeneity:** Only the correct answer includes multiple criteria and constraints. Distractors are oversimplified.
3. ⚠️ **Rule 24 — Distractor plausibility:** Distractors are easily dismissable ("build an air-conditioned playground"? "move recess indoors permanently"?). Only one distractor is remotely plausible.

**Recommended fix:** All options should include both criteria and constraints:
- F) The school needs to keep equipment cool on sunny days, using no more than $500 and within one week.
- G) The school needs to replace all metal equipment with plastic, using no more than $500 and within one week.
- H) The school needs to build a covered playground structure, using no more than $500 and within one week.
- J) The school needs to change recess times to avoid hot weather, using no more than $500 and within one week.

### 🔴 NEW Q2 — Conservation of Mass / Effervescent Tablets (SEVERE)
**PE:** 5-PS1-2 | **DOK:** 2

**Correct answer (G):** "Exactly 65 grams, because matter is not created or destroyed when substances interact" — **14 words**
- Distractor F: "Less than 65 grams, because some matter was destroyed when the tablets dissolved" — 13 words
- Distractor H: "More than 65 grams, because the gas adds extra mass to the bag" — 11 words
- Distractor J: "Exactly 50 grams, because the tablets disappeared into the water" — 10 words

**Length ratio:** 1.2x — actually acceptable.

**Violations:**
1. ⚠️ **Rule 6 — Assumed knowledge:** CRITICAL. The correct answer requires knowing that 50 mL of water = 50 grams (bag 15g + water 50g + tablets = 65g). This density relationship is NOT Grade 5 common knowledge and is NOT stated in the stimulus.
2. ⚠️ **Rule 6 — Tablet mass ignored:** The problem mentions "two effervescent tablets" but the correct answer of "exactly 65 grams" doesn't account for the mass of the tablets themselves. The mass should be 15g (bag) + 50g (water) + tablet mass = MORE than 65g.
3. ⚠️ **Scientific accuracy:** As stated, this question is actually scientifically WRONG. The total mass should be bag + water + tablets, which is more than 65g. The correct answer should be "the same as before the tablets were added" without specifying an exact number.

**Recommended fix:** Restructure to avoid requiring the density conversion and fix the scientific error:

*"A student places two effervescent tablets and water inside a sealed plastic bag and records the total mass as 80 grams. The tablets dissolve and gas bubbles form inside the sealed bag. What will the balance most likely show after the tablets have completely dissolved?"*
- F) Less than 80 grams, because some matter was destroyed
- G) Exactly 80 grams, because matter is not created or destroyed during the change
- H) More than 80 grams, because the gas adds extra mass
- J) Exactly 0 grams, because the tablets dissolved completely

### 🟠 NEW Q5 — Earth Sphere / Gravity Direction (MAJOR)
**PE:** 5-PS2-1 | **DOK:** 3

**Correct answer (C):** "Gravitational force pulls all objects toward the center of Earth, so 'down' is always toward Earth's center no matter where a person stands." — **27 words**
- Distractor A: "Earth's atmosphere holds people to the surface on all sides of the planet." — 13 words
- Distractor B: "People on the other side of Earth are actually upside down but are used to it." — 17 words
- Distractor D: "The magnetic field of Earth holds all objects on the surface in place." — 14 words

**Length ratio:** Correct answer is **1.8x** the average distractor (14.7 words).

**Violations:**
1. ⚠️ **Rule 16 — Length balance:** Correct answer is nearly double distractor average.
2. ⚠️ **Rule 20 — Complexity:** The correct answer contains a compound explanation with a "so" clause. Distractors are simple single-clause statements.

**Recommended fix:** Shorten correct answer OR lengthen distractors:
- A) Earth's atmosphere creates pressure that holds people to the surface on all sides of the planet.
- B) People on the opposite side of Earth are actually upside down, but they have adapted over time to it.
- C) Gravitational force pulls all objects toward Earth's center, so "down" always means toward the center.
- D) Earth's magnetic field creates a force that holds all objects in place on the surface of the planet.

### 🟠 NEW Q10 — Star Brightness with Data Table (MAJOR)
**PE:** 5-ESS1-1 | **DOK:** 3

**Correct answer (H):** "Star A is much closer to Earth than Star B, so its light appears brighter even though it actually produces less light." — **21 words**
- Distractor F: "Star B is broken and not producing light correctly." — 9 words
- Distractor G: "Earth's atmosphere blocks the light from Star B but not Star A." — 11 words
- Distractor J: "Star A is a newer star, so it naturally appears brighter." — 10 words

**Length ratio:** Correct answer is **2.1x** the average distractor (10 words).

**Violations:**
1. ⚠️ **Rule 16 — Length balance:** Correct answer is double distractor length.
2. ⚠️ **Rule 24 — Distractor plausibility:** "Star B is broken" is implausible/absurd. Violates Rule 24.

**Recommended fix:**
- F) Star B is farther from Earth, but its light is scattered by dust clouds between the stars.
- G) Earth's atmosphere filters out certain types of starlight, making distant stars appear dimmer.
- H) Star A is much closer to Earth than Star B, so its light appears brighter despite lower output.
- J) Star A is a younger and hotter star than Star B, which makes it appear naturally brighter.

### 🟠 NEW Q13 — Coastal Flooding Solutions (MAJOR)
**PE:** 5-ESS3-1 | **DOK:** 3

**Correct answer (B):** "Plan 2 uses knowledge of how natural systems work to reduce flooding while also supporting habitats for wildlife." — **17 words**
- Distractor A: "Plan 2 costs less money than Plan 1." — 7 words
- Distractor C: "Plan 2 does not require any human effort to maintain." — 9 words
- Distractor D: "Plan 2 will completely stop all flooding in the town forever." — 10 words

**Length ratio:** Correct answer is **2.0x** the average distractor (8.7 words).

**Violations:**
1. ⚠️ **Rule 16 — Length balance:** Correct answer is double.
2. ⚠️ **Rule 22 — Absolute terms:** Distractor D uses "completely" and "forever" — easily eliminable.

**Recommended fix:**
- A) Plan 2 costs less money than Plan 1, making it a better use of the town's budget.
- B) Plan 2 applies knowledge of natural systems to reduce flooding while supporting wildlife habitats.
- C) Plan 2 requires no human effort to maintain because natural systems repair themselves over time.
- D) Plan 2 uses proven engineering technology to permanently block all storm water from the town.

### 🟠 NEW Q15 — Ice Cube Insulation (MAJOR)
**PE:** 3-5-ETS1-2 | **DOK:** 3

**Correct answer (B):** "Team 2, because newspaper and cardboard are poor conductors of heat, so they slow down heat transfer to the ice" — **19 words**
- Distractor A: "Team 1, because aluminum foil keeps things cold" — 8 words
- Distractor C: "Team 3, because glass is the strongest material and protects the ice best" — 12 words
- Distractor D: "All three designs will work equally well" — 8 words

**Length ratio:** Correct answer is **2.0x** the average distractor (9.3 words).

**Violations:**
1. ⚠️ **Rule 16 — Length balance:** Correct answer is double.
2. ⚠️ **Rule 20 — Structural homogeneity:** Only the correct answer has a multi-clause "because... so they..." structure.

**Recommended fix:**
- A) Team 1, because aluminum foil reflects heat away from the ice, acting as an insulating barrier.
- B) Team 2, because newspaper and cardboard conduct heat poorly, slowing heat transfer to the ice.
- C) Team 3, because glass traps cold air inside the jar, keeping the ice at a lower temperature.
- D) All designs work equally well, because the ice will melt at the same rate in any container.

### 🟠 NEW Q17 — Fair Test / Bean Sprouts (MAJOR)
**PE:** 3-5-ETS1-3 | **DOK:** 3

**Correct answer (C):** "The student changed more than one variable between the pots, so any differences in sprouting cannot be attributed only to the type of soil." — **23 words**
- Distractor A: "The student used too many pots for the investigation." — 9 words
- Distractor B: "The student should have used the same type of soil in all three pots." — 13 words
- Distractor D: "The student should not have watered the plants at all during the investigation." — 13 words

**Length ratio:** Correct answer is **2.0x** the average distractor (11.7 words).

**Violations:**
1. ⚠️ **Rule 16 — Length balance:** Correct answer is about double.
2. ⚠️ **Rule 14 — Central idea in stem:** The correct answer essentially restates the entire concept of "fair testing." This is more of a definition than an answer to "why is this NOT a fair test."

**Recommended fix:**
- A) The student used too many pots, making the investigation too complicated to draw conclusions.
- B) The student kept the soil type the same but should have changed it to test different variables.
- C) The student changed the soil, location, and water amount, so the cause of differences is unclear.
- D) The student watered the plants too often, which prevented the seeds from sprouting in the pots.

### 🟠 NEW Q1 — Food Coloring Diffusion (MAJOR)
**PE:** 5-PS1-1 | **DOK:** 2

**Correct answer (B):** "The particles that make up both the water and the food coloring are constantly moving and mixing together." — **18 words**
- Distractor A: "The water pushes the food coloring to the edges of the glass." — 12 words
- Distractor C: "The food coloring evaporates and then condenses in other parts of the water." — 13 words
- Distractor D: "Light passing through the glass causes the food coloring to change position." — 12 words

**Length ratio:** Correct answer is **1.5x** the average distractor (12.3 words).

## SYSTEMATIC ISSUES ACROSS ALL 19 QUESTIONS

### Issue 1: Correct Answer is Almost Always the Longest (15/19 = 79%)
The single biggest quality issue. Item writers naturally add qualifiers and precision to the correct answer while writing quick, dismissive distractors. **Fix: After writing, count words in each option. Adjust until within 20%.**

### Issue 2: Distractors Lack Explanatory "Because" Clauses (12/19)
Many correct answers include reasoning ("because X, so Y") while distractors are bare assertions. **Fix: Give every option a "because" clause, or remove the "because" from the correct answer.**

### Issue 3: Absolute Terms Cluster in Distractors (6/19)
Words like "always," "never," "completely," "permanently," "do not contain" appear predominantly in wrong answers. **Fix: Either avoid absolutes entirely or use them equally across all options.**

### Issue 4: One Implausible Distractor per Item (8/19)
About 42% of questions have at least one distractor that no student would ever choose (e.g., "Star B is broken," "air-conditioned playground," "light causes food coloring to move"). **Fix: Replace implausible distractors with documented misconceptions from science education research.**

### Issue 5: Scientific Accuracy (1/19)
N2 has a factual error (ignoring tablet mass in the "exactly 65 grams" answer). **Fix: Always have subject-matter experts verify the scientific accuracy of both the correct answer and all distractors.**
